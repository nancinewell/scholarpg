# Overview
I'm expanding my Python learning to web apps. To this point, I've used Python with Tkinter and Arcade to run frontends, and honestly didn't know that using Python on a web app was an option until recently and wanted to explore it.

This app is one that has been on my project list for a while. It is a hub used for school gamification, where the students' character with experience, gold, level, skills, and skill points are housed. From here, the teacher can select a student and increase their experience and/or gold for good behaviors, and track what skills are available to students and when they use them. 

As this has a backend and is not currently hosted, you can start a python test server to run the app by using the command prompt: py manage.py runserver. This will run it to your local host. Just pull up a browser and go to 127.0.0.1:8000 to access the app. 

As always, I try to use my learning to forward my homeschool. My children and I have been doing something like this for a few years now, but we just manage it on spreadsheets. I'm excited to put this together so that our characters can be more automated and require less maintenance from me. 



{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running (starting the server and navigating through the web pages) and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Web Pages

{Describe each of the web pages you created and how the web app transitions between each of them.  Also describe what is dynamically created on each page.}

# Development Environment
I wrote this program in the IDE Visual Studio Code version 1.105.1 with 4 extensions to make it more friendly to Python: Pylance, Python, Python Debugger, and Python Environments.

I wrote this program using Python and Django as the web framework.

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}
* I want to add a shop for the kids to spend their gold on.
* I want to add a pet shop. Each pet has powers (something we're currently manageing with the spreadsheet)
